                        Hello, my name is Andi Surya Priyadi, as of 6/11/2023 I am still an informatics student at Sultan
                        Ageng Tirtayasa University. there are many things that I learned in this department,
                        but from the initial semester more emphasis was placed on web creation, I was taught html,
                        css, and also php, there was also a css framework that had been taught by lecturers, namely boostrap,
                        but I felt that the material presented was not qualified to equip me to enter the world of work,
                        so I decided to learn javascript and its framework, react, by myself.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        I started pursuing Front end starting from a few months ago,
                        because basic html and css have been learned so it makes it a little easier for me to
                        learn Front end. to learn Front end, in previous projects almost all parts have been obtained,
                        such as the front end using boostrap, the back end using sql and php. sql and php, maybe for now
                    </li>
                </ul>
